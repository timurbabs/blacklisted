Access the PHP application:

Since the application is exposed via a NodePort service, you can access it with:

  minikube service php

Or manually:

  1. Get your Minikube IP:
     minikube ip

  2. Get the exposed NodePort:
     kubectl get svc php

  3. Then open the following URL in your browser:
     http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>/?n=5
